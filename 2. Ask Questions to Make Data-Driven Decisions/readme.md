# Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions

This folder contains datasets and starter guidance for exploratory analysis and asking data-driven questions. The goal is to practice turning raw data into insights by forming and answering clear, testable questions.

## Contents

## Suggested workflow
1. Inspect the raw data
   - Open the Excel files in Excel or import into Google Sheets / Python (pandas).
   - Check for missing or inconsistent values and note field types.
2. Ask focused questions
   - What business or policy decisions could this data inform?
   - Which metrics matter (e.g., daily revenue, product mix, growth rates, population change)?
3. Clean and prepare data
   - Normalize date formats, handle missing values, standardize categorical labels.
4. Explore and visualize
   - Use summary tables, group-bys, time series plots, and maps (for population data).
5. Answer and communicate
   - Produce a short write-up, charts, and actionable recommendations.

## Example questions to explore

Bakery Sales
- Which products generate the most revenue and profit per day?
- What are peak sales days/times? Are there weekday/weekend patterns?
- How does average transaction size vary by day or product category?
- Which items should be promoted to increase average order value?

Population (Latin & Caribbean)
- Which countries show the highest growth or decline (2010–2019)?
- Are there regional patterns in population change?
- How do country-level trends compare when normalized per 1,000 people?

## Recommended tools
- Quick exploration: Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel
- Reproducible analysis and more advanced visuals: Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, plotly) or R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Mapping (if needed): QGIS, plotly, or folium for Python

## Deliverables / Outputs
- Cleaned dataset(s) or a documented notebook showing cleaning steps
- Short analysis notebook or spreadsheet with charts
- One-page summary with 3–5 actionable insights and recommended next steps

## Notes & best practices
- Keep a changelog of cleaning steps and assumptions.
- When sharing results, include context: data source, time range, and limitations.
- Cite the Google Sheet for collaborative tracking of questions and findings.
